## 🚀 Overview
NEUROS is a **local-first AI memory and reasoning engine** that makes your AI truly persistent.  
It remembers past interactions, recalls relevant knowledge, and performs **multi-step reasoning** across sessions.

Think of it as:
- **Personal Edition** → “Your AI’s permanent memory” on your machine.  
- **Enterprise Edition** → “Your organization’s collective AI brain.”  

---

## ✨ Features
- 🧠 **Persistent Memory** – Store, organize, and recall knowledge across projects.  
- ⚡ **Reasoning Engine** – Combines **local LLMs** with **symbolic logic** for structured reasoning.  
- 🔐 **Privacy First** – Runs locally with optional **encrypted cloud sync**.  
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** – Track interaction patterns, knowledge growth, and reasoning accuracy.  
- 🔌 **Integrations** – Desktop App, CLI, Browser Extension (Personal) → Enterprise SaaS, APIs, Knowledge Systems.

## 🎯 Target Users
- Researchers managing long-term projects  
- Developers building AI-assisted systems  
- Writers & creators ensuring narrative consistency  
- Students learning complex subjects  
- Organizations managing institutional knowledge

## 🏗️ Architecture
Core components:
1. **Memory Layer** → SQLite + DuckDB + ChromaDB (structured + analytical + vector memory)  
2. **Reasoning Layer** → Quantized LLMs (local) + symbolic logic (PyDatalog)  
3. **Learning Layer** → Adapts to user feedback & preferences  
4. **Interfaces** → CLI, Desktop App (Electron), Browser Extension
